This project provides a bash script ([niftyreg_build.sh](https://github.com/kh296/niftyreg-build/blob/main/niftyreg_build.sh))
for building NiftyReg executables and libraries on Linux or MacOS,
based on the instructions at:

-  [http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg_install](http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg_install)

The script obtains the source code by cloning:

- [https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg](https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg)

Variables that may need to be modified by the user are indicated in the script.

A compressed tarball containing executables and libraries built for
Linux is linked in the [Releases](https://github.com/kh296/niftyreg-build/releases).  The date (YYYY.MM.DD) in the tarball name indicates the date of cloning
of the NiftyReg repository used in the build.
